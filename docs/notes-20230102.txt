=======================================

flow of the creating a device is to have an API that simple loads a template into the nodered frame ! 
i can design a template file that will used the same for nodered stuff !  
and after that we can just call flow microservice in order to load the saved flows  so programmatically 
 => I gonna expose the device API that will helps us to do that ! the flow microservice will called using RabbitMQ 
 => Other thing is when the flow is created / Loaded i can track the id of that with RabbitMQ  : SO basically , we send the changes throught RabbitMQ channal

=====================

Another thing i need to focus on it is the first handshake of the microservices !
